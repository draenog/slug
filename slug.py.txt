DESCRIPTION
-----------

Facilitates common task in work with PLD git repositories


OPTIONS
-------

-d <directory>::
--packagesdir <directory>::
    The local repositories are assumed to reside in $HOME/PLD_clone directory. Use this
    options if you want to use a different location.

--depth <depth>::
    Fetch at most the specified number of commits for every updated branch.

-j <threads>::
    Set the number of threads which are used for fetching operations.

COMMANDS
--------

'clone' <pattern> ...::

Clone the repositories which names match at least one of <patterns>.

'fetch' <pattern>...::
For every local repository matching at least one of patterns fetches upstream changes
and updates remote branches. It is synonymous with 'update -b \* -nn'.

'init' package ....::

Creates list of packages on the server side and initialize local repositories to follow them.

'list'::

Print the names of upstream repositories matching at least one of patterns.
+
With '-b' <pattern> only repositories containing a branch matching the pattern are
listed. Multiple '-b' options are allowed.

'update' <pattern>...::

Update the remote branches in the set of packages that match at least one of patterns.
        -b <pattern>;;
        --branch <pattern>;;
            Only the remote branches which names match the pattern are updated. If omitted 
\'master'
            is assumed.
        -n;;
        --newpkgs;;
            If the local repository does not exist it is initialized and the specified branches are fetched.
        -nn;;
        --nonewpkgs;;
            Update only the existing local repositories. No new local repositories are created. It is the default
            behaviour.
        -P;;
            Remove stale local packages, which were already removed upstream.
